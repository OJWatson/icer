## Motivation

`icer` was designed to assess for interference between *Plasmodium* species to 
see if some species appeared in infections more often than expected under the 
assumption of independent random infection events, i.e. one species type is
introduced from one infectious bite. 

`icer` works out the most likely population frequency of each species and the 
most likely number  of infection types in individual by comparison to the 
observed data. These are then used to test if our data can be explained by this 
distribution by comparing the observed data to the bootstrapped samples 
from the resultant multinomial distribution describing the probability of 
being infected with each infection compositon type. 

The approach is somewhat generic and could be used for any coinfection or 
cooccurence data in which the observed prevalence of events may not be 
predictive of the frequency of the infecting entities.

## Example

Let's assume we have some data about occurence of *Plasmodium falciparum*, 
*malariae* and *vivax* as follows:

```{r data}
data <- c("pf" = 902, "pm" = 14, "pv" = 44,
          "pf/pm" = 9, "pf/pv" = 29, "pm/pv" = 1, 
          "pf/pm/pv" = 1)

```

We can test to see if any of the coinfection types occur more or less than 
best explained by the data and the independence model. 

```{r icer}
library(icer)
res <- cooccurence_test(data)
```

The resultant plot suggests that independent infection events explain this data
well, with the boostrapped estimates from the best fitting model including 
the observed data well (5%-95% quantile in blue, median in white and observed
data in red).

We also can seee what the best estimate of the frequencies of each species, the 
mean number of infections (different to number of different species, i.e. you could
have 6 infections but be Pf/Pv if you have 4 Pf infections and 2 Pv infections). 

```{r params}
str(res$params)
```

## Extensions Needed

1. Currently infections is escribed by a zero truncated poisson distribution 
and would be good to include a more dispersed zero truncated negative binomial. 

2. Tweak the independence assumption and explore the assumption that there could
be some suppresion, i.e. if the first strain is Pf, the prob of Po is lower and
fit this too in our model. 

3. Incorporate alternative explanations for "suppression". One could simply be 
fine scale spatial heterogeneity in the prevalence of the species, i.e. what 
looks like suppression is just fine spatial patterns with different frequencies of 
each species, and as such your more likely to see mono species infection because 
of local hotspots of a particular species.
