## Motivation

`icer` was designed to assess for interference between *Plasmodium* species to 
see if some species appeared in infections more often than expected under the 
assumption of independent random infection events, i.e. one species type is
introduced from one infectious bite. 

`icer` works out the most likely population frequency of each species and the 
most likely number  of infection types in individual by comparison to the 
observed data. These are then used to test if our data can be explained by this 
distribution by comparing the observed data to the bootstrapped samples 
from the resultant multinomial distribution describing the probability of 
being infected with each infection compositon type. 

The approach is somewhat generic and could be used for any coinfection or 
cooccurence data in which the observed prevalence of events may not be 
predictive of the frequency of the infecting entities.

## Example

Let's assume we have some data about occurence of *Plasmodium falciparum*, 
*malariae* and *vivax* as follows:

```{r data}
data <- c("pf" = 902, "pm" = 200, "pv" = 44,
          "pf/pm" = 9, "pf/pv" = 29, "pm/pv" = 1, 
          "pf/pm/pv" = 1)

```

We can test to see if any of the coinfection types occur more or less than 
best explained by the data and the independence model. 

```{r icer}
library(icer)
res <- cooccurence_test(data)
```

The resultant plot suggests that independent infection events do not
perfectly explain this data, with the predicted number of pf/pm being too 
high, with the boostrapped estimates from the best fitting model notincluding 
the observed data well (5%-95% quantile in blue, median in white and observed
data in red).

We can then change what type of model we use to describe the acquisition of 
species. For example maybe there is some interference between falciparum and 
malariae and the inverse for falciparu and vivax. We can specify starting values
for how the probability of acquiring an additional strains depends of the first
strain acquired. e.g. `k_12` is the multiplication of the probability of the 
next infection being `pm` given the first infection was `pf` and vice versa, 
i.e. next infection being `pf` given the first infection was `pm`. (The numbers
refer to the species by alphabetic order):

```{r}
res_interf <- cooccurence_test(data, density_func = icer:::interference, 
                               k_12 = 0.5, k_13 = 2, k_23 = 1)
```

That's a lot better! We can see what the best estimate of the frequencies of 
each species, the mean number of infections (different to number of different species,
i.e. you could have 6 infections but be Pf/Pv if you have 4 Pf infections and 2
Pv infections), and the values for the interference. 

```{r params}
res_interf$params
```
